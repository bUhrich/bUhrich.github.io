    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>This is my home page! My name is Benjamin Uhrich and I am a student at 
    <a href="http://www.fullerton.edu/">Cal State Fullerton</a> and my major is Computer Science.</p>

    <h3>CPSC 120</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Lab 4
            <p>Lab 4, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because the program my partner and I created is useful in the real world. The program we coded is used to convert millimeters to other units of measurement. This was a fun lab because I enjoy math and creating the equations was a nice challenge to my skills.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Lab 2
            <p>Lab 2, part 1 was one of my favorite labs I worked on this semester because it gave me a clear understanding of using Github and the terminal commands. These skills were new to me as I have had no prior experience using Github or the Linux terminal. They set me up to be successful in the rest of this course and in my future career.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Lab 3
            <p>Lab 3, part 1 was another favorite lab of mine because it helped me review topics I learned in high school. My partner and I created an equation to calculate a man or woman’s BMR and returned the value based on the user’s input. I also learned how to properly test and format my code using the “make test” and “make lint” commands.</p>
