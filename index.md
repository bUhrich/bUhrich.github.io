### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because the program my partner and I created is useful in the real world. The program we coded is used to convert millimeters to other units of measurement. This was a fun lab because I     enjoy math and creating the equations was a nice challenge to my skills.
  
* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 1 was one of my favorite labs I worked on this semester because it gave me a clear understanding of using Github and the terminal commands. These skills were new to me as I have had no prior experience using Github      or the Linux terminal. They set me up to be successful in the rest of this course and in my future career.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was another favorite lab of mine because it helped me review topics I learned in high school. My partner and I created an equation to calculate a man or woman’s BMR and returned the value based on the user’s           input. I also learned how to properly test and format my code using the “make test” and “make lint” commands.
